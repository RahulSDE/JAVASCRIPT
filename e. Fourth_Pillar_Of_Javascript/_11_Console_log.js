    ************* Console.log **********************
    -> It is not a core javascript feature.
    -> It is runtime feature because javascript doesn't know about console.
    -> Runtime provides both synchronus as well as asynchronous feature.
       If runtime provides synchronous feature then the code will work have synchronous flow.
